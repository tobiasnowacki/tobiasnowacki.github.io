# Welcome!

I am a PhD Student at Stanford University's Department of Political Science. Broadly speaking, my work focusses on political economy in developed democracies, applying innovative computational and statistical methods. More specifically, I am interested in how electoral incentives affect strategic decision-making under aggregate uncertainty: how do voters and politicians change their behaviour when they learn more precise information about the next election, and how do institutions, such as electoral systems, moderate such changes? I am working with Gary Cox, and Andy Hall at Stanford, and Andy Eggers at Oxford.

I hold a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Warwick and an MSc in Politics Research from the University of Oxford (St. Cross College). Before coming to Stanford, I was enrolled for the DPhil in Politics at the University of Oxford (Nuffield College).
